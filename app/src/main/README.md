Jyunioni App
===================================

This app is for the use of students of the University of Jyväskylä. 

The app has two tabs. First tab has an event calendar which compiles 4 organisations publicly available events from their website calendars.

These organizations are the following:
* Linkki Jyväskylä Ry.
* Pörssi Ry.
* Dumppi Ry.
* Stimulus Ry.

If you wish your organizations calendar to be featured in the app, please contact me via email.


Events are shown in a list in ascending order by the time they begin. Clicking an event opens up event details page from where the user can go the official page of the event (URL). 

The second tab is a real-time shoutbox that requires a Google log-in. Messages being sent is spread across all users of the app. Google log-in is by default required to use the app. 


The app is by default in Finnish and also localized for English users.
